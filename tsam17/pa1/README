## structure

First bind port given from command line to localhost port

Wait indefinitely for something to arrive from a client

Check if first two bytes of message from client contain the RRQ status code and if so:

    Split client message into file_name and mode

    construct full path to file given the data folder argument and client request. If request from client contains backslash, deny it with ERROR pack

    If file doesn't exist, send ERROR to client

    If it does exist, open a file stream.

    For each data pack(block) sent back to client:

        Construct the block that will be sent back to client with the appropriate opcode and block #

        send to client the message, and await response

        If all is ok, we receive ACK pack so the sending of packs continues.

If first two bytes indicate WRQ:

    Send error message back to client

When transfer is complete, the server waits for another client until prompted to close(ctrl c)
